## Current Progress

### Implemented Features
- Letters learning interface (`/learn/letters`)

  - Progressive unlocking system (first 5 letters unlocked by default)
  - Individual letter learning pages with three types of exercises:
    - Letter Recognition
    - Sound Exercise (UI only, audio not implemented)
    - Word Examples
- Progress tracking API endpoints
  - Letters progress (`/api/progress/letters`)
  - Numbers progress (`/api/progress/numbers`)
- Achievement system for mastering letters and numbers

### Known Issues
- Prisma client needs initialization (see Setup Instructions)
- Audio playback not implemented for letter sounds
- Authentication system needs proper setup

## Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Initialize Prisma:
```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Run database migrations (if you haven't already)
npx prisma migrate dev
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
